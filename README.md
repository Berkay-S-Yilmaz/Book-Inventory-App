# Book-Inventory-App
I made this app for my brother (who is an avid reader), he uses it store and manage data on all of the books that he owns.
This Application is made up of two main files: backend.py (uses sqlite3 for the database 'books.db') and frontend (uses tkinter as the toolkit for the GUI)
The user interface of this application is very minimal, its naviagtion and usage is fairly intuitve making it easy to use.

The script can be executed through the 'frontend.exe' file in the 'dist' folder. Or it can be ran directly through Python
